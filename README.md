# Tic Tac Toe @ Reactjs

## Takeaway Learning

The ReactJS Tic-Tac-Toe project was aimed at creating a user-friendly game application for fun. The project involved setting up a ReactJS frontend with Vite and deploying the application using Netlify.

### Technical Skills Acquired

1. **ReactJS**: Improved my understanding of React components, state management, and hooks. Learned how to structure a React application for scalability. (https://react.dev/learn)
2. **Git and GitHub**: Enhanced my skills in version control, including branching, merging, and resolving conflicts. Learned how to effectively use GitHub for project collaboration and remote repository management. (https://github.com/harpreetsinghdt/reactjs-tic-tac-toe)
3. **Netlify Deployment**: Gained experience in deploying a React application on Netlify, including handling environment variables and configuring custom domains. (https://tic-tac-toe-harp.netlify.app/)

### Challenges and Solutions

1. **State Management**: Initially struggled with managing state across multiple components. But then learned and implemented successfully. (https://react.dev/learn/managing-state)
2. **Lifting State Up**: Sometimes, we want the state of two components to always change together. To do it, remove state from both of them, move it to their closest common parent, and then pass it down to them via props. (https://react.dev/learn/sharing-state-between-components)
3. **Outputing Content Condtionaly**: Sometimes, we want the content to show up as per some conditions to be true or false which is managed by conditional content rendering, we can conditionally render JSX using JavaScript syntax like if statements, &&, and ? : operators..(https://react.dev/learn/conditional-rendering)
4. **Updating Gradient Color On State Change**: It was really a fun part to learn how gradient backgroud colors could be updated with the state change while rendering the updated results. (https://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_gradients.asp)

### Soft Skills Developed

1. **Problem-Solving**: Enhanced my ability to troubleshoot and debug issues efficiently, ensuring a smooth development process.
2. **Time Management**: Learned to prioritize tasks and manage time effectively to meet project deadlines.

### Future Improvements

1. **Advanced State Management**: Plan to explore Context API and Redux for more complex state management needs in future projects.
2. **Testing**: Intend to integrate more comprehensive testing using tools like Jest and React Testing Library to ensure code reliability.
3. **Performance Optimization**: Aim to focus on optimizing application performance and improving load times by implementing lazy loading and code splitting.

### Conclusion

The ReactJS Tic Tac Toe project was a valuable learning experience that enhanced my technical and soft skills. The challenges faced and solutions implemented have prepared me for more complex projects in the future. I am now more confident in my ability to build and deploy scalable web applications using ReactJS and related technologies.
